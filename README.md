- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nichathan-Gaming.
- 👀 I’m interested in creating video games and applications. I also like to record this process to share with others.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, music and art. I am also always learning new tricks for coding in every language.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of my projects. I am not artistic or musical at all so if you want to provide art or music for my projects, I will be happy to consider having you join the project.
